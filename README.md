# CA Education Agency Tracker

Watches California education-related agencies' meeting pages, plus AG opinions and ballot
initiatives. It flags new or changed agendas, searches agenda items and linked documents for
the team's keywords, and tracks which postings someone has reviewed.

## Status

| Agency | Automated | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AG Legal Opinions | Yes | One posting per opinion; pending → issued shows as an update |
| AG Ballot Initiatives | Yes | Amendments (e.g. 26-0006A2) update the original initiative |
| Commission on Teacher Credentialing | Yes | Reads the portal's data feed and each meeting's items |
| Office of Public School Construction | Yes | Meetings appear before their documents are posted |
| California School Finance Authority | Yes | Items come from each meeting's staff reports page |
| Fair Political Practices Commission | Yes | |
| CalPERS | Yes | Committee agenda pages for the two latest months |
| CalSTRS | Yes | All committees of each board meeting |
| CCEE | Yes | Via the site's public WordPress API (the HTML page is behind Cloudflare) |
| State Board of Education | Yes, paced | One page per run from an office computer; see below |
| Advisory Commission on Charter Schools | Yes, paced | Same site as SBE |
| California Practitioners Advisory Group | Not yet | Same site; page couldn't be fetched to build against |
| FCC Open Commission Meetings | Yes | Via the Federal Register API (fcc.gov denies automated requests); the notice PDF is searched |
| Educational Audit Appeals Panel | Not yet | Behind Cloudflare with no public feed: check by hand |

Agencies that aren't automated show in the dashboard as "Not automated yet: check by hand".

**cde.ca.gov (SBE, ACCS):** the site's bot protection (Radware) lets an
occasional request through but challenges several in a row, and challenges
GitHub's servers outright. So SBE and ACCS are checked from an office computer
(a self-hosted GitHub runner; set the repository variable `USE_OFFICE_RUNNER`
to `true`), one page per run: meeting lists first, then new agenda pages, then
re-checks of upcoming agendas. Agenda pages include each item's subject, which
keyword matching uses; item documents aren't downloaded. Each request is
logged (`crawl_log`), and every run's summary shows how often CDE accepted
requests at different spacings. Pacing is adjustable with repository
variables: `CDE_MIN_GAP_MINUTES` (default 100), `CDE_PAGES_PER_RUN` (default 1)
and `CDE_PAGE_GAP_SECONDS` (default 90). A challenge pauses CDE checks for 2
hours, doubling with each further challenge up to 24 hours.

## How it behaves

- **New / Updated since review / Reviewed:** review status is shared across the team. If a
  reviewed agenda later changes (an item is added, or a linked PDF is revised), it moves back to
  **Updated since review**.
- **First run:** when an agency is scraped for the first time, its past meetings are loaded as
  "Already posted" so the inbox doesn't start with hundreds of items. Upcoming meetings still
  show as **New**.
- **Keywords:** these are matched against posting titles, agenda items, and the text of linked
  PDFs, HTML pages and .docx files. There are three match types:
  - *Word:* the whole word, plurals included ("charter" matches "charters" but not "chartered").
  - *Exact phrase.*
  - *Regex.*

  A keyword can apply to all agencies or to one. Adding a keyword also searches everything
  already collected.
- **Documents:** linked documents are re-downloaded for meetings up to 14 days in the past, so
  revised agendas and late attachments are caught. If a download fails, the last good copy is
  kept.
- **Scraper health:** an agency counts as failing if its scraper errors, or suddenly finds
  nothing. After 3 failures in a row, it shows a red badge in the dashboard and `ADMIN_EMAILS`
  get an email.
- **Email:** each person chooses no email, a daily digest (about 7am Pacific), or immediate
  alerts. They can also limit alerts to certain agencies, or to postings with keyword matches.

## Setup

### 1. Supabase (database and logins, free tier)
1. Create a project at https://supabase.com.
2. Apply the migration: in the SQL Editor, run `supabase/migrations/20261030000001_init.sql`.
   Alternatively, use `supabase db push` with the Supabase CLI.
3. Under **Authentication → Sign In / Providers**, turn **off** "Allow new users to sign up".
   Then invite each team member from **Authentication → Users → Invite user**.
4. Under **Authentication → URL Configuration**, set the Site URL to your dashboard's URL
   (from step 3 below).
5. Note down three values:
   - Project URL and anon key: **Project Settings → API**.
   - Database connection string: **Connect → Session pooler**. This is `DATABASE_URL`.

### 2. Resend (email, free tier)
Create an account at https://resend.com, verify a sending domain (or use their test sender
while trying it out), and create an API key.

### 3. GitHub repository
1. Push this code to a GitHub repo.
2. **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, then add:
   - **Secrets:** `DATABASE_URL`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` (e.g.
     `Agency Tracker <tracker@yourdomain.org>`), `ADMIN_EMAILS` (comma-separated).
   - **Variables:** `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `DASHBOARD_URL` (e.g.
     `https://yourorg.github.io/ca-ed-tracker`), and optionally `TRACKER_USER_AGENT` with a
     contact address so agencies can reach you.
3. Under **Settings → Pages**, set Source to **GitHub Actions**. The **Deploy dashboard**
   workflow then publishes the site.
4. **Check agencies** runs on its schedule. To run it now, open **Actions → Check agencies →
   Run workflow**.

## Development

```bash
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Tests need a Postgres server where they can create databases:

```bash
TEST_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/postgres pytest
```

See what the scrapers find, without needing a database:

```bash
python -m tracker run --no-db --agency sbe
```

Run the full pipeline against the database, then roll everything back (it prints any keyword
matches):

```bash
python -m tracker run --dry-run --agency sbe
```

Dashboard:

```bash
cd web && cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in the Supabase URL and anon key
npm install && npm run dev
```

### Adding a scraper

Create `tracker/scrapers/<agency>.py` with a class that subclasses `Scraper`, sets `agency_id`,
and implements `fetch(fetcher) -> list[Posting]`. Register it with the `@register` decorator,
and import the module at the bottom of `tracker/scrapers/__init__.py`.

A scraper only describes what the listing page shows: postings, their items, and document
links. The pipeline handles downloading, change detection, matching and alerts. Save a copy of
the agency's page under `tests/fixtures/<agency>/` and test the scraper against it, so a site
redesign shows up as a failing test rather than silently missing agendas.
